## My process
The design consisted of a mobile and a desktop view. I implemented a responsive design using a single breakpoint following the design at a minimum width of 769px. In general, I prefer to use more breakpoints for a better visual appearance on different screen sizes.

For styling, I utilized React's styled components library, which offers a wide range of possibilities for larger projects. CSS properties were organized alphabetically, and I followed the BEM methodology for naming classes.

I plan to enhance the project by adding more image sizes to better adapt to various screen sizes and some extra breakpoints.  Another thing will be incorporating the react-swipeable-views library to enable image swiping on mobile devices.
